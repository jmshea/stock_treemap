'''Module to create custom, interactive stock portfolio tree maps. Pulls data from Yahoo! Finance.
Uses Plotly to create interactive treemaps. Intended for running within Jupyter Lab (or Notebook).

Main function is stock_treemap, which takes a CSV argument and optional dictionary mapping
stock tickers to sectors (strings).

Also provided separate function to replot if sectors are updated (without having to wait
for data to be pulled from Yahoo Finance, which can be quite slow). '''

        Pull financial data for stocks from Yahoo finance and generate a treemap
        to illustrate performance by sectors

        Inputs:
        csv_file = a CSV file with columns ticker (standard stock ticker symbol) and shares (number of shares owned)
        sectors (optional)= a dictionary that maps ticker symbols to sectors, both of which are strings
        cash_balance (optional) = amount not in stocks that will be added to give whole portfolio balance
        interactive (optional) = whether to display the interactive graph (presumably in a Jupyter environment).
                                 Default is True
